# Overview

When I first started with the idea of this project I wanted to create a finance calculator to help people budget their money. I had the idea have the user create an account so that there could be multiple users with different budgets worked out. Little did I know this project would then turn into a project of creating a database for users and allowing them to log in. 

My purpose for creating this software is to have it as the base code for any user database I will need to create in the future. I will now have access to this template to quickly create a system that creates a user name and password for users and saves them to some sort of file.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
